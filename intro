Harshad Shantilal Mehta was born on July 29, 1954, in a Gujarati family in Mumbai, India. 

He came from a modest background and pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce.

 Initially, he worked in a few jobs including selling hosiery, cement, and sorting diamonds.

  to support his family and gain some experience in the financial sector. His first significant break came when he joined the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as a sub-broker.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mehta began making a name for himself in the stock market

He became known as the “Big Bull” due to his large-scale investments and his ability to influence stock prices.

One of his most notable achievements was during the 1992 Indian stock market scam

He manipulated the market by using a technique called “circular trading,”

The 1992 Scam

e had used fake bank receipts and manipulated bank loans to inflate stock prices and benefit from the resulting gains.

 It was at this time that he began trading heavily in the shares of Associated Cement Company (ACC). The price of shares in the cement company eventually rose from ₹200 to nearly ₹9,000 due to a massive spate of buying from a set of brokers including Mehta.


This resulted in stocks like ACC (which was trading in 1991 for ₹200/share) skyrocketing to nearly ₹9,000 in just 3 months. 

In 1992, Harshad Mehta paid the highest income tax of Rs 24 cr, just a few weeks before the scam was exposed. In fact, some said that if he was alive and not caught, Harshad Mehta would have been richer than Mr Mukesh Ambani
